# E-commerce-transaction-dataset
This project applies data science techniques to analyze customer behavior, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights. It includes three tasks: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns, a **Lookalike Model** to find similar customers, and **Customer Segmentation** using clustering for personalized marketing.

# Customer Segmentation, Lookalike Model, and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project leverages data science techniques to analyze customer behavior, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing customer and transaction data to uncover patterns and trends.
2. **Lookalike Model**: Recommending customers similar to a target customer based on profile and transaction data.
3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**: Grouping customers into distinct segments based on their profiles and transaction behaviors.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required for this project:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
Task Breakdown
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization on the customer and transaction datasets.
Derive business insights to identify important customer behaviors, patterns, and areas for optimization.
Deliverables:
Jupyter notebook for EDA (FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb)
PDF report with business insights (FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf)
Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a model that recommends the top 3 similar customers to a given target customer.
Similarity scores are calculated using metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
Deliverables:
Jupyter notebook for Lookalike model (FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb)
CSV file with the top 3 lookalikes for each of the first 20 customers (FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv)
Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Segment customers using clustering techniques based on profile and transaction data.
Evaluate clustering using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index).
Deliverables:
Jupyter notebook for clustering (FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb)
PDF report with clustering results, DB Index, and other relevant metrics (FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf)
